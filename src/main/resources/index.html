    <h2>Hi!</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 18px; width: 800px">
    Rate My Weekend is this thing where you rate your friends' weekends, and they rate your weekends, and there's a leaderboard or whatever.
    You connect your Foursquare account, and then every Monday it pulls in your weekend check-ins for your friends
    to rate.
    It just uses your Foursquare friend graph so you don't have to worry about that.
